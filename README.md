Have you ever wanted to use Pytorch to be cool, hip, and young? But, oh no, 
how can I do the machine learning without Keras. I come across this
problem a lot. So, I'm hoping that this "shell" makes it much easier
for me to get basic machine learning models up and running quickly.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
